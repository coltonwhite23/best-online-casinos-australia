## Top online casinos in Australia in detail 

## [SPINFEVER](https://deeplogic.media/n1b92a4d8a) - Australias Best Online Casino & Bookie Site

Alright, so Spin Fever Casino was one of the first spots I checked out. I'd heard a few whispers about it online, so I thought, 'Why not give it a burl?'

The thing that grabbed me straight away was the sheer number of games. It's like walking into a proper, bustling casino – if you're not vibing with one game, there's a stack more right there waiting for you. I'm talking pokies galore, table games, the whole shebang. I reckon I could spend weeks on there and still not try everything.

I started off with a cheeky deposit, and they chucked a bonus my way, which was pretty sweet. I think it was spread out over my first few deposits. I didn't go too crazy, but it definitely gave me a bit of a boost to start with. I managed to turn my initial deposit into a bit more before I even started playing, which is always a good sign, right?

I had a crack at a few different games. There was this pokie called "Luck of Tiger" that caught my eye, and I also had a go on "Lamp of Wonder" (who comes up with these names?). To mix things up, I finished off with some Zoom Roulette and Blackjack 16. Gotta get a good feel for the place, you know?

What I liked:

- **Huge selection of games – something for everyone, no doubt. It really does feel like a real casino.
- **The welcome offer was a nice little bonus to get me started.
- **I even saw someone hit a jackpot while I was playing! Talk about FOMO.

What I didn't like: Some of the table games felt a bit dated, to be honest. They could do with a bit of a refresh.

## [ROOLI CASINO](https://deeplogic.media/n1b92a4d8a) - Australias Best Online Casino & Bookie Site

Okay, so **Rooli Casino** was next on my list. I'd heard a few things, some good, some not so good, so I was keen to check it out for myself. I spent a fair bit of time poking around, playing a few games, and generally getting a feel for the place. Here's what I reckon.

I gave their **welcome bonus** a crack – it was a decent chunk of change, which is always a good start. The **game selection** is pretty solid, with a good mix of pokies and table games. I didn't find anything super unique, but they had all the classics, and that's what matters, right?

## What I liked:

- The welcome bonus was pretty generous.
- They have a decent range of payment options, including crypto, which is handy.
- The site is easy enough to navigate, even for a bloke like me who isn't the most tech-savvy.

## What I didn't like:

- The wagering requirements on the bonus were a bit steep, to be honest.
- I didn't find any standout features that made it different from other casinos.
- The customer support was a bit slow to respond when I had a question.

---

**Overall**, Rooli Casino is alright. It's not the best I've ever seen, but it's not the worst either. If you're looking for a solid, reliable casino with a good selection of games, it's worth a look. Just be sure to read the fine print on the bonuses before you jump in.

## [KING MAKER CASINO](https://kngm.kngpulse.com/?mid=96693_1527059) - Australias Best Online Casino & Bookie Site

Okay, so King Maker Casino... where do I even start? It's got a real mixed bag of stuff going on, and I reckon it's worth a look if you're after something a bit different. The sheer number of games they've got is pretty impressive, and I found myself lost for hours just browsing through them all.

I spent a fair bit of time checking out their bonuses, and they seem pretty decent, especially for new players. I always read the fine print though, because wagering requirements can be a real pain. I reckon King Maker is worth a shot if you're looking for a new place to spin the reels. Just remember to gamble responsibly, yeah?

## [LETS LUCKY](https://letslucky.info/kcbf55e32) - Australias Best Online Casino & Bookie Site

Alright, so I gave Lets Lucky Casino a burl, and here's the yarn. Veronica, down at the pub, reckoned it was worth a look, especially with those slot tournaments she bangs on about. So, I chucked in a lazy $100 and they matched it, doubling my dosh before I even spun a reel – can't complain about that, can ya?

I had a crack at 'Luck of Tiger' first – pretty flash, I reckon. Then I had a go at 'Lamp of Wonder' (who comes up with these names, seriously?). To mix things up, I finished with Zoom Roulette and Blackjack 16. Gotta get a good feel for the place, right?

Having heaps of games is a bit overwhelming at first, but I reckon it's grouse. It's like being at a real casino – if you get bored with one game, there's always something else to try.

I reckon the tournaments are a good draw, and they've got these Cash Drops going on too. Plus, they were slinging around promos with up to $3,000,000 up for grabs, which is bonza for a casual punter like me. They even had lotteries with iPhones and Macbooks as prizes. Crikey!

Setting up an account was dead easy, and I chucked in $300 in Litecoin, which was sorted in a couple of minutes. They're matching deposits 100% up to $10,000 – wish I had that much to throw around! But doubling my $300 to $600 was a fair start.

I kicked things off with Sugar Rush 1000, a real eye-popper of a pokie. Then I tried Thunder Coins and Merge Up, both with all the flashy bits and the promise of a big win. To finish off, I had a go at Big Bass Crash and 500x.

## [FatFruit](https://fatfruit.live/n1b5eae3c0) - Australias Best Online Casino & Bookie Site


Okay, so FatFruit Casino... I had a bit of a sticky beak around this one the other day. It's got a pretty decent vibe, I reckon. Not too flashy, but not boring either. It's got that 'she'll be right' kind of feel about it, you know?

I reckon the game selection is pretty solid. They've got all the usual suspects – pokies galore, blackjack, roulette, the whole shebang. I didn't count 'em all, but there seemed to be enough to keep me occupied for a fair while. They seem to be powered by RTG, so you know the games are gonna be pretty good quality. I'm talking smooth graphics and all that jazz.

What I did like was the payment options. They've got your credit cards, e-wallets, and even crypto if you're into that sort of thing. Minimum deposit is 20 bucks, which is fair enough. And apparently, they're pretty quick with the payouts, which is always a bonus. No one likes waiting around for their winnings, right?

I didn't spend a heap of time on FatFruit, but from what I saw, it's a decent option if you're looking for a new online casino to try out. Give it a go, see what you think!


So there you have it! If you're keen on trying your luck at online casinos in Australia, you've got plenty of solid options.
